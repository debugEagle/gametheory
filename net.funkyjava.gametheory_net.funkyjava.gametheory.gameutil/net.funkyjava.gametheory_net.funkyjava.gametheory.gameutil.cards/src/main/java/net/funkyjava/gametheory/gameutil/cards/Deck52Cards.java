/**
 * <p>
 * This class has two purposes :
 * <ul>
 * <li>Bring an efficient cards drawing algorithm with the partial Fisherâ€“Yates
 * shuffle</li>
 * <li>Provide a persistent deck from where card can be drawn successively, and
 * that can be reseted. See {@link #draw(int[])} and {@link #reset()}
 * respectively.</li>
 * <li>Provide a one shot drawing method over a fresh deck with no variable
 * creations. See {@link Deck52Cards#oneShotDeckDraw(int[])}.</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The cards are integers between 0 and 51. The number of cards to draw is
 * determined by the destination array where thoses bytes will be written.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A better {@link RandomGenerator} like {@link ISAACRandom} or
 * {@link MersenneTwister} can be set via {@link #setRandom(RandomGenerator)} to
 * replace the default JDK's random.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Not thread safe.
